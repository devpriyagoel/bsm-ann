# Option Pricing using Deep Learning

The goal of this project was to use underlying asset price, strike price, treasury rate, time to maturity and other known parameters to predict the price V of an option contract. 
#### The experiments were conducted using NIFTY 50 options data obtained from https://www1.nseindia.com. For determining the treasury rates, appropriate bond yield data was extracted from https://in.investing.com.
